# Income-Qualification
#üßæ Overview of the Solution


The goal of this project is to help governments or agencies identify households in need of financial aid using data-driven methods. It leverages machine learning algorithms to classify individuals into different income categories based on features such as housing conditions, education level, and asset ownership.

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
Data Source: The dataset comes from the Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction competition on Kaggle. It contains detailed household-level and individual-level information.

Preprocessing: The notebook performs extensive data cleaning, including:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Removing irrelevant or duplicate features

Engineering new features from household relationships and dependency metrics

Modeling: Several machine learning models are tested and tuned, such as:

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)

Logistic Regression

Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1 score, with a focus on correctly identifying the most vulnerable income classes.

Output: The final output classifies each household into one of the predefined income groups (e.g., extreme poverty, moderate poverty, vulnerable, or non-poor), enabling targeted policy interventions.

#üí° Why This Matters

Government programs often face challenges in accurately identifying which households need support the most. Manual methods or outdated surveys can be inefficient and biased. This project presents a scalable, objective, and efficient alternative by using machine learning to automatically classify income levels based on factual and updated household characteristics.

#üìå Key Use Case

Government Welfare Targeting:
By deploying this solution, a government could automatically assess incoming applications or census data to determine eligibility for:

Food subsidies

Cash transfer programs

Education and healthcare benefits

This helps ensure resources are distributed more equitably and with less administrative overhead.
